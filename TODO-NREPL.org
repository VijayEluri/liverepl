 * Replace most of lein-server with an nrepl server injection

 * Need to be able to authenticate the newly created repl with a
   session id

 * Maybe implement discovery via an nrepl middleware?

 * Disconnection via a middleware?

* Launch modes

** repl mode

   liverepl starts up an nrepl, with session auth, bound to localhost,
   and a dynamic port, connects to it, and unloads nrepl when the
   client disconnects

** server mode

   liverepl starts up an nrepl, displays the port, and leaves it
   running.  the port and bind address can be configured

* Packaging

** lein

   available as a lein plugin

** standalone

   available as a bunch of jars with REPLy bundled as the repl
